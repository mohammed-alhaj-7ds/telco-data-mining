# Telco Customer Churn — Data Exploration & Modeling 📊📞

Welcome! This repository contains a notebook for exploring and modeling Telco customer churn. It's written as a friendly, step-by-step data-mining project — ideal for learning, demoing, or building a baseline churn model. 🚀

## About this project 🧭

- Goal: Explore a Telco customer dataset and build models to predict customer churn.
- Primary artifact: `data_mining_telco_FINAL.ipynb` (exploratory analysis, preprocessing, models, and evaluation).

## Dataset 📂

- The dataset used is `telco_customer_churn.csv` (included in the repo).
- Typical columns: customer IDs, account details, services, charges, tenure, and churn label.

## Quick start — run locally 🖥️

1. Create a Python environment (recommended):

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook:

   jupyter notebook data_mining_telco_FINAL.ipynb

## What you'll find inside the notebook 🔎

- Data loading and basic checks ✅
- Missing values & cleaning 🧹
- Feature engineering & encoding 🧩
- EDA (plots with Matplotlib & Seaborn) 📈
- Baseline models (Logistic Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost) 🤖
- Evaluation and suggested next steps 📋

## Tips & fun facts ✨

- Try stratified splits to keep churn ratio stable across train/test sets.
- Use SHAP or feature importance to explain model decisions (great for business stakeholders). 🧠
- Small experiments: try class-weight tuning or simple ensemble blending.

## Contributing 🤝

- Add more experiments as new notebook sections or new notebooks.
- If you add heavy dependencies, please update `requirements.txt`.

## License & contact 📨

- This is a learning/demo project — adapt freely for educational use.
